# Portfolio Website

This repository contains my personal portfolio website.

What started as a project to become comfortable with HTML and GitHub has evolved into a fully structured, multi-page portfolio showcasing my projects, skills, and ongoing development as a software/engineering student.

The site is built with a strong focus on:
- Semantic HTML
- Clear structure and accessibility
- Maintainable, scalable layout
- Progressive enhancement through CSS

---

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to:
- Present my work and projects in a clear, professional format
- Demonstrate strong fundamentals in HTML and CSS
- Act as a foundation that can be iterated on as my skills grow

This portfolio is intentionally built without frameworks to emphasise core web fundamentals before layering on additional complexity.

---

## Features

- Multi-page website (Home, Projects, Contact)
- Semantic HTML structure (`header`, `nav`, `main`, `section`, `article`, `footer`)
- Accessible navigation and content structure
- Skills table with meaningful data representation
- Project sections with images and descriptions
- External stylesheet for consistent styling
- Designed to be deployed as a static site (GitHub Pages)

---

## Tech Stack

- HTML
- CSS
- Git & GitHub
- GitHub Projects (for task tracking)

---

## Design Inspiration

Visual inspiration was taken from:

https://dribbble.com/shots/25498023-Developer-Portfolio

The final implementation is my own and focuses on clarity, simplicity, and readability rather than visual complexity.

---

## Status

This portfolio is a **work in progress**.

Planned improvements include:
- Expanded CSS styling and responsive design
- Enhanced accessibility checks
- Additional project pages
- Incremental UX refinements

---

## Deployment

This site is intended to be deployed using **GitHub Pages** once styling and structure reach a stable state.

## Notes

This project documents my learning and progression over time. Commits and structure reflect an emphasis on understanding why things work, and enhancing basic skills
